Save the earth ! Touch the ship to move it around the screen 
(to make sure you don't miss your target, or to avoid being crushed by meteors), 
and touch to aim at meteors to destroy them before they reach the earth ! 

The game is not finished, and is at least missing a proper enemies wave management, 
something to display the current earth (life) status, sfx and music.

the game is kind of optimized for the ipad (add it to home screen before using it), 
in terms of display size but as well since using multitouch is better when playing 
(as then you can both move the ship and shoot at the same time!)
